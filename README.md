## Infinite Scroats

🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐

An infinite scrolling create-react-app of goats, not to be confused with infinite scroats. 

This project is to demonstrate the speed of using reacts to load components. This app using one core component which is the Goat component. <br />

This app is my first go at React alone without following any courses or tutorials.<br />
The intention is to have an infinite scrolling site that randomly generates different goats by images, names and stories all built from one react component.<br />
